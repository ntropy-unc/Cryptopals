# Cryptopals-demo

These exercises, unlike many other CTF wargames, can be done without looking at solutions. In fact, I would encourage you to not look at them. To follow along, you should have a beginner's understanding of Python. In addition, you should be familiar with basic bitwise operations and how characters can be represented as numbers in bits. Finally, I would encourage you to look at AES ECB and AES CBC.


I had done these exercises maybe 8 or 9 months ago. Doing them again, most of them are fairly trivial. But that is not to say that my answers are perfect. Thus it would be a good idea to look at other resources in addition to this repo.


Goals:
* Do as many Cryptopal exercises as possible through Monday
* On Saturday by 12 PM, release a prerequisite sheet (maybe written in Tex).
* On Sunday by midnight, glue everything together and make sure people can follow along.
